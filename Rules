# Development Rules & Guidelines

## CRITICAL: Independent Calculator Architecture

1. **Each cost and revenue page MUST have its own dedicated calculator function**
2. **Calculator functions MUST NOT depend on each other**
3. **No shared calculation logic between different modules**
4. **All data integration must happen ONLY at the Dashboard level**

## Calculator Implementation

1. Each calculator must be located in its own file in the `/utils/calculators` directory
2. Calculator function naming must follow the pattern: `calculate[ModuleName](parameters)`
3. All calculators must accept a standardized parameter object and return a standardized result object
4. Each calculator must include detailed documentation of its parameters and calculation methodology
5. Examples:
   ```javascript
   // Employee costs calculator
   export function calculateEmployeeCosts(params) {
     // Standalone calculation logic
     return resultObject;
   }
   
   // Tech costs calculator - completely independent
   export function calculateTechCosts(params) {
     // Standalone calculation logic
     return resultObject;
   }
